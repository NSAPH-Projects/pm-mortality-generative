# Experiments

## vae _model_performance
create_images_vae.py is used to assess the performance of the trained VAEs. It recreates images from the dataset, and creates images by sampling from the latent space and simply decoding it.

## dataset_samples
First a few images from the data set. They are useful for comparing to the recreated images from the VAE.

## dataset_samples_doubled_and_clipped
Some images in the dataset had a few very bright points. Was not sure if the dataset had wrong data. These images have less difference in brightness.
